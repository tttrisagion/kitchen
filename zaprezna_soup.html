                <div class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed space-y-6">
                    <p>This is a story of profound, grass-roots resilience. As one family remembers, "We ate it often... after my dad abandoned us. Money was short but this soup was good." This isn't a recipe of convenience; it's a recipe of creation, of making something from *nothing*.</p>
                    <p>The core of this Eastern European soup is the "zaprezna," a roux made from fat and flour. This is the "base asset." From there, you add water and seasonings. The dumplings are another act of creation: flour, egg, and salt. This soup is a testament to the dignity of a mother armed with foundational knowledge, able to create comfort and sustenance from the barest of pantries.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">(Quantities are approximate, as they depend on the maker's intuition)</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg md:text-xl space-y-2">
                    <li>2-3 Tbsp. fat (lard, butter, or oil)</li>
                    <li>2-3 Tbsp. flour (for the roux)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. caraway seeds (or paprika)</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>6-8 cups water or broth</li>
                    <li><b>For the Dumplings:</b></li>
                    <li>1 or 2 eggs</li>
                    <li>~1 cup flour (or enough to make a thick batter)</li>
                    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-lg md:text-xl space-y-2">
                    <li>Make the roux (Zaprezna): In a soup pot, melt the fat over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it turns a light golden brown (1-2 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Add the caraway seeds, salt, and pepper, and stir for another 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Slowly whisk in the water or broth. Be careful, as it will steam. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Make the dumplings: In a small bowl, beat the eggs. Add the salt and slowly mix in the flour until you have a thick, sticky batter (thicker than pancake batter).</li>
                    <li>Drop small spoonfuls of the dumpling batter directly into the simmering soup. They will cook quickly.</li>
                    <li>Simmer for another 10-15 minutes until the dumplings are cooked through. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
                </ol>

                    <p><strong class="font-bold">Principle:</strong> True sovereignty comes from foundational knowledge, not from access to complex goods.</p>
                    <p>This soup is built from "first principles." The assets are the most basic: flour, fat, eggs. The *value* is created by the *knowledge* of how to transform them. The "zaprezna" (roux) is a foundational technique that can be used to create dozens of other dishes. The dumplings are another.</p>
                    <p>This is the essence of human dignity and freedom. A person who knows *how* to make a roux, *how* to make a dumpling, or *how* to build a system is sovereign. They are not dependent on a government program for a box of "soup mix." They can create value from the base elements of the earth. This knowledge is the ultimate asset, a God-given power that no economic crash can take away.</p>
