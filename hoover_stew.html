                    <p>This dish has many names, but it's most famously known as "Hoover Stew." It was a meal of necessity, served in the shantytowns ("Hoovervilles") that sprang up across America. These communities, filled with families who had lost everything, mockingly named their settlements after President Herbert Hoover, who many blamed for the crisis.</p>
                    <p>The stew itself is a lesson in scarcity. It was rarely the same twice, made from whatever could be gathered, scrounged, or given from a relief line: macaroni, canned tomatoes, and whatever "meat" was available—often hot dogs or canned sausage. It was a bottom-up, communal solution to a top-down systemic failure. It wasn't pretty, but it was hot, filling, and shared.</p>

                    <p><strong class="font-bold">Principle:</strong> Centralized systems fail; decentralized networks endure.</p>
                    <p>"Hoover Stew" wasn't a government program. It wasn't a corporate handout. It was a "grass roots" solution created by people with nothing. When the centralized systems of banking and government failed them, they fell back on the only system that works: their local community. They pooled resources (trading a can of tomatoes for a handful of noodles) and created value from what others saw as waste.</p>
                    <p>This is the first principle of `trading.kitchen`: True wealth and stability are found in decentralized, adaptable systems—in our communities, in our skills, and in our ability to create and trade value directly. This stew is a symbol of human dignity—the God-given right to survive and build, even when the "official" systems have declared you bankrupt.</p>
