# Roadmap: trading.kitchen 

## Mission Statement

Provde the knowledge and tools to maximize individual freedom and increase the quality of life for all people.

## Priorities

1. Move the website to a CMS for easy maintinance and removal of repetitive header/footer/navigation within the static HTML pages which includes the ability to add images for the place cards on the homepage, categorizations, structured ingredients lists so a user can browse anything with `beef` category for example. We also want to make a list of all the other non ingredient things you need (a pot, whisk, knife, etc.)
2. The we make a data feed for each input product for each receipe and we provide a real time price of each meal calculated per individual adult or child portion so a user of the site can navigate the best meal option with the resources and equipment they have.
3. Provide an API for bulk additions of recipes and pulling down price feeds. It needs to integrate with something like OpenAI with docs and a user interface that allows a user to interact with the interfaces.
4. Allow for users to post their own comments with photos after a moderator approves the content. Also allow a user to submit their own Depresssion era
5. Include a Google Analytics pixel and maybe something like scrolling heatmaps
6. Integrate terms with dynamic Grokipedia based pages for example **United Fruit Company** text on the Banana Bread recipe would allow the user to be toaken to a page on Trading.Kitchen based on the contents of https://grokipedia-api.com/page/United_Fruit_Company with attribution to Grokipedia indicated along with a link directly to the article instance on Grokipedia.com
